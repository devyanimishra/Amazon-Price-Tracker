# Amazon-Price-Tracker
A simple program using Python that tracks a specific product's price on Amazon and notifies you!

This program uses web scraping via the BeautifulSoup library in Python and SMTP library also in Python to send you an email once a change has been noticed.
You can change what product you want to track just by changing the URL in the code.
You can also add a Time function so that the program runs continuously in the background and keeps tracking the code for you!
